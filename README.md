-----------------------------------
Procedure
-----------------------------------

step 1: Install the above libraries and frameworks.

step 2: After successfully installing, open any python IDE or Command-Line.

step 3: Open Command-Line, change the directory to the project folder, and then run the 		VC.py file.
        Note: Make sure all files should be in the same folder.

step 4: After successfully done with execution, then it's open the window that accesses 		the webcam.
step 5: By moving the Palm (Hand) throughout the webcam, can control the system's 			volume.
        while moving the Index finger of the Palm from right to left throughout the 			screen then it controls the volume in an increase to decrease order.
        while moving the index finger of the Palm from left to right throughout the 			screen then it controls the volume in a decrease to increase order.

step 6: As we implement the controlling of screen brightness also,
        Here while moving palm throughout the screen in the x-axis then it controls the 		system's Volume.
        Here while moving palm throughout the screen in the y-axis then it controls the 		system's Brightness.

step 7: Here we control the system volume and brightness through the index finger of the 	palm by using the system webcam.
